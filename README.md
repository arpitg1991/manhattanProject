Tech Discussion-
-----------------------
Software Architecture:
MVC?
Anjishnu - Ham ko naa pata

Controller Stack:
Ruby on Rails?
Scala?
Anjishnu - I'm leaning towards Scala for a bunch of reasons-
1) The companies I want to work for (Coursera/LinkedIn/Twitter) are all migrating to Scala
2) I already know Java - so Scala is like a JVM Power up
3) Ruby and Python as languages are very close to each other in terms of syntax and capabilities - Scala is very different. 
4) RoR devs are a dime-a-dozen, there's no shortage of job opportunities, but the average quality of those jobs isn't very high. Scala has much fever developers and the average job quality is pretty high.


DB:
Mongo?
HBase?
Cassandra?

Anj - No experience with any of them. Would appreciate input from someone who has played with each. Leaning towards Mongo/Cassandra simply because of the companies associated with them.

View:
Bootstrap?
Reuse some appealing templates?

Anj - We were leaning towards making an Android app rather than a WebApp. I am a fan of bootstrap in case we go the web dev route though.
